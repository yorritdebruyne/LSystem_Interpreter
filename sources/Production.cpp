// This class represents a single production.
// A production is a replacement rule, it tells us which symbol
// to look for, and what (sequence of) symbol(s) to replace it with.
// The original symbol is usually called a “predecessor”.
// The (sequence of) symbol(s) is usually called a “successor”.
